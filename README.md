# ClassUpdate

Update class names of all themes in a folder.

- [discordscripts](https://github.com/NyxIsBad/discordscripts) by NyxIsBad (aka. nightflower) for the formatted changes list.
- and especially [Update-Classes](https://github.com/SyndiShanX/Update-Classes) by SyndiShanX for the inspiration.

1. Download this tool

    ├── replace.py

```


## Config
The config for this script is stored in `config.ini` and can be edited with your favourite text editor (eg. Notepad++).

### Variables
#### ThemeDirectory
- The location of the themes directory to update.
- A path relative to the `ClassUpdate` directory.
- Default: `themes`
#### FileExtension
- The file extension of the files to update.
- Default: `css`
#### UseLocalDiff
- Whether or not to use a local (instead of online) changes file.
- Use `yes` or `no`.
- Default: `no`
#### DiffLocation
- The location of the changes file.
  - If using local diff, a path relative to the `replace.py` file.
  - If using online diff, a full URL.
- Default: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SyndiShanX/Update-Classes/main/Changes.txt`

### Creating a new profile
The `config.ini` has two profiles provided, `DEFAULT` and `local`. You can also create new profiles to store various configs.

1. Add a section to `config.ini` starting with the name of the profile in square brackets:
   ```ini
   [UpdateScss]
   ```
2. Underneath, copy and edit variables you wish to change from the `DEFAULT` profile. Any missing variables will inherit its value from `DEFAULT` automatically. This example profile will update `scss` files in `MyThemes` directory using the online changes file at `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SyndiShanX/Update-Classes/main/Changes.txt`:
   ```ini
   [UpdateScss]
   ThemeDirectory: MyThemes
   FileExtension: scss
   ```
3. Save your changes before running `replace.py`. Enter your profile name when prompted, without square brackets.
